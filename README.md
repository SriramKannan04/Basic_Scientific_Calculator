As a fresher in web app development, I've poured my heart into crafting this calculator application. 
Despite the challenges of integrating arithmetic operations alongside functions like x^2 and x^3, as well as SinꝊ, CosꝊ, and TanꝊ.
I'm diligently working to address these complexities. 
I'm hopeful that my efforts will be acknowledged, and my skills recognized.

Thank you
